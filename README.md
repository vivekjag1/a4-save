## Personal finance tracker - React.js 

Deployment link - https://a4-vivekjag1-ba5f0679ec8d.herokuapp.com/

This is an application which allows users to track their spending habits. The application allows users to create a purchase, which has a price and the current cash on hand for the user. The application determines if the user can afford the item (if it is less than 15% of their cash on hand)

Changed from a3
- Login page: I added a login page to make it more obvious that the user is logged in.
- React: I refactored the entire frontend to use react.
- Heroku deployment - the app switched from vercel to heroku because vercel doesn't really support API deployments.


I found react to be significantly better than vanilla HTML. I have familiarity with it, so it sped up development. Setting up the project was difficult though (I was aided by webstorm's create vite app). I also found deployment to be more complicated, but Heroku made it simple enough.
